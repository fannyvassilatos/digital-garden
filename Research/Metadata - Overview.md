# Metadata / Overview

There are **issues** with the current model of the Web

- Information overload

    → Impossible trinity + signal<>noise ratio

- Attention economy

    → Ad-based revenue model

- Centralization (GAFAM)
    - Algorithms, advertising bias

    → Sameness of thinking

- Fragmentation
    - Of tools, devices, apps... (lack of interoperability)

→ All of which make for very hard sensemaking on the Web + lack of agency/control

As designers (creators of visual communication systems), we need to rethink the Web in order to unify the means of dissemination, access and reception of information. 

Draw conclusions

- Micropayments (monetization)
- Integrated/unified platform where users has access to content from multiple sources and where information is sorted/filtered/targeted.
- Customizable workspace / digital environment

My three main chapters/focuses are:

## **Dissemination (issuers)**

**How is information thrown into the world?**

Issuers, information sources

- Monetization & economic model : subscriptions, micropayments,
- Change the current mindset where we currently expect everything to be free

Common place of information

- WeChat as example of integrated app

## **Access (customization)**

**Channels — How does information reach us?**

Contact and interaction between user and information feeds

Content curation, Social bookmarking, Browsers, Save-for-later, Browsers, Interest Graph APIs

Push vs Pull : Chatbots as example of user pulling information instead of apps pushing notifications

## **Assimilation (reception, appropriation, cognition)**

**How is content absorbed by the readers?**

Digestion of the information by the user

Open annotation, Finding wisdom in data, commonplace books, Personal Information Management (PIM), Bringing information to another level, Exploiting it in a new way

I want to present what it "should" be in an ideal world and following the idea of a Semantic Web.

**Jan 08 2018:** Ughhh... i'm just realizing that save-for-later and browser features all relates to Access as well! so many of my topics overlap multiple chapters... would there be a better way to structure it all?

# Issue <> Solution breakdown

/thumb_1642.jpg

## 1. Dissemination: Unified platform allowing access to content from multiple sources
Solution: "go-to" centralised place\
Issue: Fragmentation
	
Solution:\
A system to garantee the information is:
- Authoritative (Source's authority)
- Up-to-date (Source's recency)
- Comprehensive (Source's quality)

Issue: Trifecta

Solution: Micropayments\
Issue: Ad-based revenue model

## 2. Access: Information sorted and customized based on interests 
Solution:\
Content curation filter
- Based on facts and tags, not alorithms, in the likes of a Semantic Web

Issue: Algorithms / advertising bias

Solution: Interest Graphs\
Issue: Centralization

Solution: Channels (targetted flux of information)\
Issue: Attention economy

## 3. Reception: Customizable workspace
- Intuitive interface
- Manipulation and visualisation of content inspired by data visualization techniques

Solution: Save-for-later\
Issue: Information overload

Solution: Open annotation\
Issue: Centralization

Solution: Interoperability\
Issue: Fragmentation
