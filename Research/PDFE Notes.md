## **[The Causes of Information Overload Today](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/information-overload-why-it-matters-and-how-to-combat-it)**

There are, of course, nearly as many causes of information overload as there are bits of information available to us. However, the most common reasons behind modern information overload include:

- Huge volumes of new information being constantly created
- Pressure to create and compete in information provision – leading to a quantity over quality effect in many industries
- The [simplicity](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/simplicity) of creating, duplicating and sharing of information online [*Include this in some way*]
- The exponential increase in channels to receive information by; radio, television, print media, websites, e-mail, mobile telephony, RSS feeds, etc.
- The increasing weight of historical data available to us
- High volumes of conflicting, contradictory and plain old inaccurate information
- No simple methodologies for quickly processing, comparing and evaluating information sources
- A lack of clear structure in groups of information and poor clues as to the relationships between those groups

## **Avoiding Information Overload in Designs**

The question then becomes; how do we help our users avoid information overload – what can we as designers do to try and alleviate the burden of information?

Tips to avoid information overload in designs include:

- **Keep things simple.** The less information you present – the easier it is to understand.
- **Keep it relevant.** Information that actually meets the user’s needs is less likely to overwhelm.
- **Keep it clear**. Simplicity and relevance are good but information needs clarity to be effective.
- **Provide supporting information**. If a [user needs](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-needs) more information, make sure it’s to hand for them.
- **Provide balanced information.** You should present both sides of the coin rather than just one.
- **Make it clear what is to be done with the information.** What action should the user take? Why should the take it?
- **Make it easy for the user to take action.** If they need to complete a task there and then make it accessible and make it obvious.

We are now at the start of a new wave: the prosumerization of the enterprise.

Superhuman Command, a popup that can be invoked by pressing Cmd + K

In a [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/email-is-broken-can-anyone-fix-it/), Rahul Vohra, founder of Superhuman, cites that the product is engineered to get you into a "flow state."

- Positioned as a premium product vs. free alternatives.
- Built as an opinionated product experience for a specific use case and/or target audience.
- Driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts.
- For power users

## Command / spotlight `pattern`

Command *centers?* Quick search? Quick find? are becoming more and more widespread and are a great pattern to enhance usability, encourage feature discovery and educate about keyboard shortcuts. I use it in Slack, MacOS, Sketch and wish it was everywhere! Helps build muscle memory, reduce clicks and accelerate workflows.

## Fullscreen `pattern`

Swiping between multiple desktops or switching with cmd+tab is such an effective way to stay focus on the task at hand. This was one of the principles behind the Mercury OS concept.
