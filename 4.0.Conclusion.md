# Conclusion
By putting together the founding principles of the systems and services presented earlier, we start to develop the theoretical basis for a web platform that could allow a standardization of the means of dissemination, access and assimilation of information. This ideal system would offer the user a single centralized location, a global portal where to navigate, consult and absorb all the knowledge of the world.

**Dissemination**   In terms of dissemination of information, it would be about proposing a unified platform giving access to contents of multiple sources; a go-to centralized digital space where all information can be found. This would establish a system that can ensure that information is authoritative, up-to-date and comprehensive. In addition to ensuring the reliability of information sources, this utopian platform should be viable and would operate according to a business model based on micro-payments.

**Access**   About access to information, it would be about proposing a personalization of information feeds. The information would thus be delivered to the user according to fact-based filtering, keywords as in the context of the Semantic Web (the data behind the data, information behind content) using channels (targeted information flows).

**Assimilation**   Finally, when it comes down to the reception of the information by the user, the proposal would be a customizable workspace, an intuitive interface that allows manipulation of the information inspired by the principles of data visualization. A platform that combines assimilation tools such as save-for-later, open annotation, a reliable archiving system, an adequate search engine and all of that maintained in total interoperability.

In the end, my goal was to bring the experience of the Web closer to that of human thought. To surpass the limit of our cognitive abilities, we invented the Web;

> « Technology is an expression of human will (The Shallows) »

> « Through form and function, tools are analogies of our bodies (iA) »

The least we can do is aspire to seize to its full potential the cognitive progress that it can bring us. 

To resume, I tried to gather all the tools and features that could, if unified in a single browser or OS, allow us to bring the experience of the Web closer to that of human thought. 

I want to pursue research and discussions around the parallel to be made between the functioning of the Web and our cognitive functioning.
