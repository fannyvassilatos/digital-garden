## Information overload causes an impossible trinity of information
- Information overload has direct consequences on the way we read, learn and apprehend the world around us.
    > “ Information anxiety is the human cost of information overload.”
- We are now placed before [the impossible trinity of information](http://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/http://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/http://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/)

    > “A fundamental problem faced by the general public and the members of an academic discipline in the information age is how to find the most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date information about an important topic.” 
    — Edward Zalta, philosopher at Stanford’s Center for the Study of Language and Information
Those three requirements—”authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date”—are to information what the “impossible trinity” is to economics. You can only ever have one or two at once.
- Signal to noise ratio is augmenting exponentially
→ Harder than ever to filter through the noise 

## The attention economy keeps us stuck in  ad-based revenue models (monetization)
- Why are we still stuck with the first model the Web has ever known?
"Just as Amazon started with books, the Web started with Ads" (find tweet)
    - Business model: we are the product
    - Interface: Windows, tabs, buttons, text fields,  etc.
- Why we expect not to pay for anything on the Web?
- How can we shift this mindset?
→ We got used to trading our privacy for free services and products.

## Centralization of sources (GAFAM's Big Five) 
- algorithms
- advertising bias
- sponsored search results
→ More and more of us are afraid of an imminent sameness of thinking. We all get recommended the same ads, share the same content. Diversity of thought is being menaced by information monopolies.

## Information fragmentation (of tools)
- Several different tools exist to manage this problem. Yet their plurality brings forth a new one; information fragmentation.
    - of devices
    - of ecosystems
    - of technologies, tools, apps
→ lack of interoperability

→ All of which create an overwhelming sense of **confusion**
→ Lack of **agency** & control over our own digital environments
→ Accounts for very hard **sensemaking** on the Web
This utopian platform should help the user find meaning in the Web of information **(sensemaking)**. It should allow them to **feel at home** in what they read, discover and learn. (Personal Information Management)

	What is the Semantic Web a solution to? (only replaces search algorithms?)

Several different tools exist to manage this problem. Yet their plurality brings forth a new one; information fragmentation.

If we take the successful parts of all tools and apps working in this direction, we might end up with the basis of an ideal platform / OS / browser.

Here are some examples of services where these principles are applied.

A single virtual identity connected to all sources of information would simplify our usage of the Web.

> “Because working with a collection of personal information – that you yourself has collated/curated – feels like thinking, it’s a sort of natural extension to your memory.” 
[KFTF]

I'm aiming to bring the experience of the Web closer to that of human thought.
