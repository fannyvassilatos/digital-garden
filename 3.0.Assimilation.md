# Assimilation

{{TOC}}

## Intro
Consolidation?

Information assimilation signifies the cognitive act of consuming the content. The reading, understanding, and appropriation of information. This often involves manipulation of information, the ability to reorganize and classify it.

The ideal interface would propose means of assimilation worthy of the time when book was the media of information *par excellence*. Annotating, highlighting, cutting, keeping, archiving, documenting, classifying.

This should be the interaction between user and information; instinctive. A direct user interface, a mediation between human and content limited to its clearest form.

Ideally, there would have to be a system where it's easy to find the links that we consider relevant, to organize the knowledge that we learn and that we want to keep aside. A whole area of ​​research examines this facet; it is Personal Information Management (PIM). Whether it is to offer the user the possibility of entering an immersive view, a focused, continuous reading, without hyperlinks, advertising or distractions, to complete a long reading, or to personalize their display options, or to offer them an open annotation space where they can comment and share with others the content they consume, as many means are possible for them to easily visualize, and in various ways, all the information that they collect, so that they can reorganize it, check if it is still relevant, keep the links up to date and link new elements between them.

## Browsers
### Vivaldi
Many of us often do not realize that there are several other web browsers than the most popular (Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox). The Vivaldi browser, for example offers a highly customizable web browsing experience. By testing the use of Vivaldi, you quickly realize that the web browsing we are used to is extremely restricted. Vivaldi offers so many options for navigation and customization of the interface that you quickly finds yourself exploring the various options and adjusting and personalizing your "ergonomics" of use. Vivaldi really helps prioritize the tools you use. With quick commands, it offers one place to take control of your browser. We can finely organize our tabs with the stacking and juxtaposition options. Also, a notes panel is always available.

Vivaldi's unique feature set:

- Customize Everything
	- Make the web yours 
- Quick Commands
	- Control everything in your browser from one place 
- Tab Stacks and Tiling
	- Organize Your Tabs 
- Write Notes on the Go
	- Easy to use, always around when you are in need 
- Web Technology
	- Built for the web, with the Web 
- Adaptive interface
	- Vivaldi ’s color scheme will adapt as you browse the web, much like a chameleon adapts to its surroundings. A clean and modern look complements the content. Facebook turns Vivaldi blue, The Verge will make it orange – If you so wish.
- Spatial navigation
	- Say goodbye to tab-cycling through web page content now. You can move in every axis using the arrow keys. Get faster anywhere on the web page using your keyboard.
- Powerful bookmarks
	- How many bookmarks d you have in your browser? 56, 225, or 1056? If you use bookmarks a lot, you have come to the right place! With Vivaldi's bookmark manager you can organize and access your bookmark efficiently. You can set your own tags and nicks for lightning fast access.
- Web panels
	- Web Panels allow you to view websites as a panel on the sidebar of your Vivaldi browser. Read news, follow conversations on social media, chat with your friends and much more, while using the main browser window separately. It’s the next best thing to having a “Boss Button” on your browser.

### Opera 
- Stay in sync
	- Easily pick up browsing where you left off, across your devices. Just sign in to your Opera account to sync browsing data - bookmarks, open tabs, passwords and typed history. Remember to get the Opera browser for your mobile device to stay in sync on the go.
- Speed through the web
	- Making Opera a fast browser is our priority. We’ve added improvements to speed it up on slower computers with traditional hard drives. Also, if you’re on a slow internet connection, Opera Turbo can compress pages for faster browsing.
- Personalize your browser
	- Over 1,000 extensions make it easy to customize Opera. Download the extensions and themes you like from Opera's add-ons catalog to get the best browser experience with a personal touch. With the animated themes, you can even bring Opera's start page to life.
- Keep it simple
	- Searching and navigating the web is a breeze, with Opera's intuitive combined address and search bar. Pick one of the preinstalled search engines like Google, Yahoo! or Wikipedia, or add a custom search engine. You can also customize keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures.
- Stay safer and more private
	- Opera keeps your browsing safe, so you can stay focused on the content. Our secure browser protects you from fraud and malware on the web, and our private windows help you stay incognito online. Or, to enhance your privacy options, even on public Wi-Fi, try the VPN solution from SurfEasy.
- Get more done
	- Recently closed tabs, tab cycling and other small improvements save you time online. Also, with visual bookmarks, not available in any other browser by default, you can get back to interesting sites quickly. View them as a thumbnail gallery or in a classic tree format.
- Get the latest news
	- With Opera’s restyled news feature, you can get to the the latest articles in your language straight from the browser’s start page. Customize your news feed by choosing the most relevant topics from the list: Technology, Sports, Lifestyle and more.

It is clear that the web browser is basically located at the intersection of the three main axes (Dissemination, Access, Assimilation) because it is in this digital place that we can standardize the sources of information, customize the means of access and gather all the tools necessary for its appropriation.

### Pivot
[Microsoft Live Labs](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/dd4a479f-92d6-496f-867d-666c87fbaada/) 
*[TEDtalk 2010 : Gary Flake : Is Pivot a turning point for web exploration?](https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_flake_is_pivot_a_turning_point_for_web_exploration#t-344764)*

In Microsoft’s research labs, Gary Flake and the Pivot team have developed a data visualization tool. In a TedTalk from 2010, he demonstrated it live. He begins by manipulating, using the Pivot software, data concerning mortality rates by classifying them by sex or age group. He then proves that this concept can go even further when he takes the cover pages of Sports Illustrated magazines as *raw material*, which he classifies in order of publication or according to the celebrity that is showcased, and all this in a just a few clicks. It is when he begins to manipulate information straight out of Wikipedia that we understand the real scope that this project can have. With the principles of data visualization, Flake proves to us that the idea of Web browsing to which we have become accustomed rests in fact only on few intuitive elements.

> «We’re navigating the web for the first time as if it were actually a web. Not from page to page, but at a higher level of abstraction.»

> «Instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information. And, instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge. And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there’s wisdom to be found.»

## Save-for-later

### Pocket 
Pocket is a mobile and desktop application as well as a browser plugin for saving articles, videos, web pages —basically anything—, save them for later and view them offline. In a time of instantaneity such as ours, many "*save for later*" services exist and are very popular. Their use becomes like an extension of the use of the Web. Pocket now has 22 million users, with a bank of 2 billion saved items. The ubiquity of this type of service only confirms that in an optimal use of the Web, these types of tools really need to be integrated, merged into the very interface of web browsing. It makes no sense that we should be using a third-party to collect the information we love on the web. Logically, the Web should allow us to have our personal space by default, a *home* in the infinitely large scope of the Internet.

My personal experience with Pocket has changed my view of information on the Web. Since I can archive and organize the articles or web pages that really interest me, my information selection criteria are stricter. Based on the items that I save, that I read and that I tag, Pocket offers me, via a weekly newsletter, links that are likely to interest me. This is how I discover new sources of information. The more I explore, the easier it is to recognize which are reliable or of good quality. So I start to record more articles from quality sources, which encourages Pocket to show me even more, and so on. Pocket becomes like my personalized *corner* of the Internet, I dwell on the recommendations that Pocket offers me based on my data since they arise directly from my own fundamental interests.

## Open Annotation
[**Hypothes.is**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCkm0lL-6lc) 
The mission of Hypothesis is to create a whole new "layer" over the Web; a higher level of information where annotation and discussion are open to everyone and allow the free sharing of knowledge. The Hypothesis team claims to be able to allow “a conversation over the world’s knowledge.” Their watchword is "interoperable": Interoperability is the ability of a product or system, whose interfaces are fully known, to work with other existing or future products or systems without restriction of access or implementation. From an open source perspective, they believe that simple tools can help us all improve the quality of the information on the Internet. 

> « Our team is building an open platform for discussion on the web. It leverages annotation to enable sentence-level critique or note taking on top of news, blogs, scientific articles, books, terms of service, ballot initiatives, legislation and more. Everything we build is guided by our principles. In particular that it be free, open, non-profit, neutral and lasting to name a few.”

Annotating All Knowledge

*A new open layer is being created over all knowledge.*

A coalition of some of the world’s key scholarly publishers, platforms, libraries, and technology organizations are coming together to create an open, interoperable annotation layer over their content.

For personal note-taking, peer review, copy editing, post-publication discussion, journal clubs…

It is going to bring this new layer upon human knowledge, an additional strata of conversation over publications

Annotating is a way of us understanding the social impact of the work that we do.

[Content Mine](http://contentmine.org/) founder, Peter Murray Rust, states that the principle of open annotation carries political value.

> « Politically, it’s terribly important that citizens of the world feel that they own the public Web and that it’s not controlled by central providers that have a narrow and very often monetary oriented way of presenting this content. So it’s democracy, and it’s innovation.»
—*Peter Murray Rust*, Founder, Content Mine

## Commonplace Books
[**Robert Darnton](http://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/robert-darnton)**  
«[Apologie du livre : Demain, aujourd’hui, hier](http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/NRF-Essais/Apologie-du-livre)» 2009 

In his book, *Apologie du livre : Demain, aujourd’hui, hier*, published in 2009, Robert Darnton confirms where our instinct for annotation comes from as a means of appropriating information.

A graduate of Harvard and Oxford, Darnton is an American historian, specialist in European Enlightenment. He is a professor at Princeton University and director of the Harvard University Library.

In *Apologie du livre*, Darnton draws a parralel between electronic means of communication and the power unleashed by Gutenberg more than five centuries ago; he measures the anthropological effects it's had on reading as well as the mutual advantages that link the Internet and libraries. In the *La lecture et ses mystères* chapter, he presents the anas (collections of quotations) that people had the habit to keep while reading. According to him, these notebooks that we filled with quotes, notable facts and thoughts, enabled the reader to shape the material of the world.

> "Reading and writing were inseparable activities. They were both part of a continuous effort to make sense out of things because the world was filled with signs and you could read your way through; by keeping a reading log, you made a book of your own, marked with the seal of your personality."\
