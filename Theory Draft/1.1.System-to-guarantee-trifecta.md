## System to garantee trifecta

Chapter 6: The Knowledge Portal, quick access to the best information on all topics

The main difficulty of browsing the web is to find the most reliable and quality sources. Google gives us quick access to millions of links (many of which are sponsored) but gives access to biased content. "In an ideal world, an Internet search engine should help us find the best, most neutral and most objective sources of information on all topics."

Jean Lanoix theorizes a globalized Internet service that would be overseen by an international organization called the "Knowledge Portal" and whose mission would be to "offer quick access to the best knowledge available on the planet to date". Its business model would be the reason for its success. This portal would be an international pole of attraction for the world leaders in all fields. Groups of specialists and independent experts from  different fields would collaborate with filmmakers and production companies to create multimedia documents that would meet the portal's selection criteria. The content must absolutely correspond to the requirements of the organization. Organizations can proudly display the official Knowledge Portal Accreditation logo on their home page if they meet the following 8 criteria:

1. Always provide the best information available (recent and reliable information)
2. Strive to convey information that is easy to understand for the general public and even for more targeted audiences (popularization effort)
3. Do not accept funding from sponsors who might have interests in the knowledge field (Possibility to obtain sponsorships, as long as donations from private foundations do not affect the information on the site)
4. Accept a limited amount of advertising by advertisers with a special interest in the subject (20%)
5. Have no direct affiliation to organizations of activists or political and union interest groups (prohibited affiliations because these "committed" organizations tend to present information in order to generate emotional reactions from the public )
6. Do not own, in whole or in part, a business or organization with interests to protect or promote (the organization must prove that there is no source of conflict of interest)
7. Constantly seek objectivity and maintain efforts in this direction through the use of contextual feedback functions (perfect objectivity is utopian. On the screen, a feedback icon is always present and allows any user to send comments)
8. Do not sell products and services other than information (must not sell products and services that place them in a conflict of interest)

Possible solutions for the Knowledge Portal to emerge right now: targeted advertising + micropayments.
