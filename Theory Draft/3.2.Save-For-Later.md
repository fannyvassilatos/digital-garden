## Save-for-later

### Pocket 
Pocket is a mobile and desktop application as well as a browser plugin for saving articles, videos, web pages —basically anything—, save them for later and view them offline. In a time of instantaneity such as ours, many "*save for later*" services exist and are very popular. Their use becomes like an extension of the use of the Web. Pocket now has 22 million users, with a bank of 2 billion saved items. The ubiquity of this type of service only confirms that in an optimal use of the Web, these types of tools really need to be integrated, merged into the very interface of web browsing. It makes no sense that we should be using a third-party to collect the information we love on the web. Logically, the Web should allow us to have our personal space by default, a *home* in the infinitely large scope of the Internet.

My personal experience with Pocket has changed my view of information on the Web. Since I can archive and organize the articles or web pages that really interest me, my information selection criteria are stricter. Based on the items that I save, that I read and that I tag, Pocket offers me, via a weekly newsletter, links that are likely to interest me. This is how I discover new sources of information. The more I explore, the easier it is to recognize which are reliable or of good quality. So I start to record more articles from quality sources, which encourages Pocket to show me even more, and so on. Pocket becomes like my personalized *corner* of the Internet, I dwell on the recommendations that Pocket offers me based on my data since they arise directly from my own fundamental interests.
