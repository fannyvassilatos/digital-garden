# Premise
The premise of this project is to develop the theoretical foundations of a Web platform that could, in an utopian way, group all the sources of information present on the Web in order to standardize the ways of dissemination, access and reception of information.

This would offer the user a single centralized location, a comprehensive portal where he could navigate, consult and absorb all the knowledge of the world.
