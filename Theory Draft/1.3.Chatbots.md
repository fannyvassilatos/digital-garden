## [Chatbots](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3058818/how-facebooks-big-bet-on-chatbots-might-remake-the-ux-of-the-web) (WeChat and soon Facebook)

The point of this chapter is not so much about what bots bring to the Dissemination aspect (well yeah actually, the idea that the users fetched information instead of being fed it) but mainly the integrated experience that WeChat offers (pocket article).

Chatbots are communications spaces that take the form of instant messaging interfaces, but that actually share content generated by bots —virtual agents or conversational agents— managed by companies and based on keywords. [In China](http://www.fastcompany.com/3056721/most-innovative-companies/a-week-behind-the-great-firewall-of-china?utm_content=buffer3ff0a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer), the digital landscape is vastly different than ours. There, censorship is severe and the inhabitants, not having access to Google or Facebook, rely on the widely used app WeChat for virtually everything related to information retrieval on the web. It's on WeChat that they have group chats between friends, but it's also via WeChat bots that they order a taxi, look up the weather, or get their news. This centralized system has proven to be very intuitive and has quickly integrated the daily lives of the people. Of course, the chatbot phenomenon is gradually exiting the walls of China. Facebook has recently announced they'd integrate some bots within the Messenger app.

> “What are bots? Think of them as interactive services that provide a conversational experience and contrast them with traditional “static” apps.” 
Phil Libin (Medium)

> “In a static UX, you have to learn how to operate each control; push this tab to go here, then swipe left, then push the little ‘i’ button, and so on. In a conversational UX… you just have a conversation. This doesn’t necessarily mean speech input and output, or texting, although it’ll often include those elements. It means that the product understands what you want to do and responds dynamically.”

> “That’s going to require a whole new approach to design.”

any company can now build a chatbot that users can talk with.

> "To me it's about bringing back all the best parts of the interaction between people and businesses," David Marcus, vice president of messaging products at Facebook, says in an interview. "What we’re trying to build with bots are rich conversational experiences. That’s what we believe will be the future of interactions and services."

But there are deep reasons why chatbots make sense. The app model has stalled out: People don’t use a ton of apps, and they don’t download many either. The reason is simple: There’s an enormous amount of friction associated with learning about a new app, downloading it, signing up for it, and then remembering you even have it.

> “That’s why the experience with bots is less free-form than real chat. You’re presented with a series of options that you click, progressively telling the bot your preferences for how often you’ll be notified or what kinds of information you’d like to receive—"Like a *Goosebumps* choose your own adventure book," explains Jeremy Goldberg, a product designer for business and platform at Facebook.”

Bots are going to be based on four design guidelines: That the bots should be conversational, issuing messages in a natural tone of voice and short, pithy responses paced quickly but not so quickly that the bot is oppressively present—like a chat partner hanging on your every word and expecting just as quick of a response. The responses themselves can be interactive bubbles. Some let you horizontally scroll through a list of sweatshirts via Everlane or a list of popular stories via CNN. Others present options that you can tap—for example, you could share your present location with a weather app like Poncho—thus quickly making your conversations more useful.
