«[Apologie du livre : Demain, aujourd’hui, hier](http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/NRF-Essais/Apologie-du-livre)» 2009 

In his book, *Apologie du livre : Demain, aujourd’hui, hier*, published in 2009, Robert Darnton confirms where our instinct for annotation comes from as a means of appropriating information.

A graduate of Harvard and Oxford, Darnton is an American historian, specialist in European Enlightenment. He is a professor at Princeton University and director of the Harvard University Library.

In *Apologie du livre*, Darnton draws a parralel between electronic means of communication and the power unleashed by Gutenberg more than five centuries ago; he measures the anthropological effects it's had on reading as well as the mutual advantages that link the Internet and libraries. In the *La lecture et ses mystères* chapter, he presents the anas (collections of quotations) that people had the habit to keep while reading. According to him, these notebooks that we filled with quotes, notable facts and thoughts, enabled the reader to shape the material of the world.

> "Reading and writing were inseparable activities. They were both part of a continuous effort to make sense out of things because the world was filled with signs and you could read your way through; by keeping a reading log, you made a book of your own, marked with the seal of your personality."\
