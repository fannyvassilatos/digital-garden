# Assimilation

## Intro
Consolidation?

Information assimilation signifies the cognitive act of consuming the content. The reading, understanding, and appropriation of information. This often involves manipulation of information, the ability to reorganize and classify it.

The ideal interface would propose means of assimilation worthy of the time when book was the media of information *par excellence*. Annotating, highlighting, cutting, keeping, archiving, documenting, classifying.

This should be the interaction between user and information; instinctive. A direct user interface, a mediation between human and content limited to its clearest form.

Ideally, there would have to be a system where it's easy to find the links that we consider relevant, to organize the knowledge that we learn and that we want to keep aside. A whole area of ​​research examines this facet; it is Personal Information Management (PIM). Whether it is to offer the user the possibility of entering an immersive view, a focused, continuous reading, without hyperlinks, advertising or distractions, to complete a long reading, or to personalize their display options, or to offer them an open annotation space where they can comment and share with others the content they consume, as many means are possible for them to easily visualize, and in various ways, all the information that they collect, so that they can reorganize it, check if it is still relevant, keep the links up to date and link new elements between them.
