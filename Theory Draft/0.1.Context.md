# Context
At a time of data and information overload, how should the reader, the learner, the human behave in order to make sense of it all? How might we respond to such an overdose of content? It sometimes seems impossible to distinguish or even access quality information, of official sources, that are presented in such a way that optimizes understanding and cognition. The digital revolution puts every internet user in a state of infoglut.

> “Every technology is an expression of human will. Through our tools, we seek to expand our power and control over our circumstances – over nature, over times and distance, over one another. Our technologies can be divided, roughly, into four categories, according to the way they supplement or amplify our native capacities. One set […] expands our physical strength, dexterity or resilience. A second set, which includes the microscope, the amplifier […] extends the range or sensitivity of our senses. A third group, spanning such technologies as […] the birth control pill, and the genetically modified corn plant, enables us to reshape nature to better serve our needs or desires. The map and the clock belong to the **fourth** category, which might best be called […] “intellectual technologies”. These include all the tools we use to expand or support our mental powers – to find and classify information, to formulate and articulate ideas, to share know-how and knowledge, to take measurements and perform calculations, to expand the capacity of our memory. […] It is our intellectual technologies that have the greatest and most lasting power over what and how we think. They are our most intimate tools, the ones used for self-expression, for shaping personal and public identity, and for cultivating relations with others.”

## Maps = space

## Clocks = time

## Writing/Reading = knowledge 
→ language, and now the Web

> “[…] Web’s tendency to turn all media into social media will have a far-reaching effect on styles of reading and writing and hence on language itself.”
p.106-107

> “If working memory is the mind’s scratch pad, then long-term memory is its filing system. […] In order for us to think about something we’ve previously learned or experienced, our brain has to transfer the memory from long-term memory back into working memory. […] Experiments indicate that as we reach the limits of our working memory, it becomes harder to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information, signal from noise. We become mindless consumers of data.”
p.123-124-125

> “The mental functions that are losing the “survival of the busiest” brain cell battle are those that support calm, linear thought – the ones we use in traversing a lengthy narrative or an involved argument, the ones we draw on when we reflect on our experiences or contemplate an onward or inward phenomenon. The winners are those functions that help us speedily locate, categorize, and assess disparate bits of information in a variety of forms, that let us maintain our mental bearings while being bombarded by stimuli. These functions are, not coincidentally, very similar to the ones performed by computers, which are programmed for the high-speed transfer of data in and out of memory. Once again, we seem to be taking on the characteristics of a popular intellectual technology.” (Survival of the busiest brain cell, or how our brains are becoming computers)

**[iA.net](https://ia.net/know-how/improving-the-digital-reading-experience)** on **Improving The Digital Reading Experience [tools = analogies of our bodies]** 

“The hammer is an extension of the hand. Glasses are an extension of the eye, the radio an extension of the ear. As long as our tools are recognizable as analogies of our body, the form and function of these tools are easily comprehensible.

But once you enter the digital realm, analogies with our body break down. Instead, digital tools are analogies of analogies. Text editors are an analogy of typewriters, typewriters are an analogy of writing with pen and paper, writing with pen and paper is, initially, a substitute for our memory. In general the computer now works as an extension for our head controlling those tools.”
