## Browsers

### Vivaldi
Many of us often do not realize that there are several other web browsers than the most popular (Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox). The Vivaldi browser, for example offers a highly customizable web browsing experience. By testing the use of Vivaldi, you quickly realize that the web browsing we are used to is extremely restricted. Vivaldi offers so many options for navigation and customization of the interface that you quickly finds yourself exploring the various options and adjusting and personalizing your "ergonomics" of use. Vivaldi really helps prioritize the tools you use. With quick commands, it offers one place to take control of your browser. We can finely organize our tabs with the stacking and juxtaposition options. Also, a notes panel is always available.

Vivaldi's unique feature set:

- Customize Everything
	- Make the web yours 
- Quick Commands
	- Control everything in your browser from one place 
- Tab Stacks and Tiling
	- Organize Your Tabs 
- Write Notes on the Go
	- Easy to use, always around when you are in need 
- Web Technology
	- Built for the web, with the Web 
- Adaptive interface
	- Vivaldi ’s color scheme will adapt as you browse the web, much like a chameleon adapts to its surroundings. A clean and modern look complements the content. Facebook turns Vivaldi blue, The Verge will make it orange – If you so wish.
- Spatial navigation
	- Say goodbye to tab-cycling through web page content now. You can move in every axis using the arrow keys. Get faster anywhere on the web page using your keyboard.
- Powerful bookmarks
	- How many bookmarks d you have in your browser? 56, 225, or 1056? If you use bookmarks a lot, you have come to the right place! With Vivaldi's bookmark manager you can organize and access your bookmark efficiently. You can set your own tags and nicks for lightning fast access.
- Web panels
	- Web Panels allow you to view websites as a panel on the sidebar of your Vivaldi browser. Read news, follow conversations on social media, chat with your friends and much more, while using the main browser window separately. It’s the next best thing to having a “Boss Button” on your browser.

### Opera 
- Stay in sync
	- Easily pick up browsing where you left off, across your devices. Just sign in to your Opera account to sync browsing data - bookmarks, open tabs, passwords and typed history. Remember to get the Opera browser for your mobile device to stay in sync on the go.
- Speed through the web
	- Making Opera a fast browser is our priority. We’ve added improvements to speed it up on slower computers with traditional hard drives. Also, if you’re on a slow internet connection, Opera Turbo can compress pages for faster browsing.
- Personalize your browser
	- Over 1,000 extensions make it easy to customize Opera. Download the extensions and themes you like from Opera's add-ons catalog to get the best browser experience with a personal touch. With the animated themes, you can even bring Opera's start page to life.
- Keep it simple
	- Searching and navigating the web is a breeze, with Opera's intuitive combined address and search bar. Pick one of the preinstalled search engines like Google, Yahoo! or Wikipedia, or add a custom search engine. You can also customize keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures.
- Stay safer and more private
	- Opera keeps your browsing safe, so you can stay focused on the content. Our secure browser protects you from fraud and malware on the web, and our private windows help you stay incognito online. Or, to enhance your privacy options, even on public Wi-Fi, try the VPN solution from SurfEasy.
- Get more done
	- Recently closed tabs, tab cycling and other small improvements save you time online. Also, with visual bookmarks, not available in any other browser by default, you can get back to interesting sites quickly. View them as a thumbnail gallery or in a classic tree format.
- Get the latest news
	- With Opera’s restyled news feature, you can get to the the latest articles in your language straight from the browser’s start page. Customize your news feed by choosing the most relevant topics from the list: Technology, Sports, Lifestyle and more.

It is clear that the web browser is basically located at the intersection of the three main axes (Dissemination, Access, Assimilation) because it is in this digital place that we can standardize the sources of information, customize the means of access and gather all the tools necessary for its appropriation.

### Pivot
[Microsoft Live Labs](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/dd4a479f-92d6-496f-867d-666c87fbaada/) 
*[TEDtalk 2010 : Gary Flake : Is Pivot a turning point for web exploration?](https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_flake_is_pivot_a_turning_point_for_web_exploration#t-344764)*

In Microsoft’s research labs, Gary Flake and the Pivot team have developed a data visualization tool. In a TedTalk from 2010, he demonstrated it live. He begins by manipulating, using the Pivot software, data concerning mortality rates by classifying them by sex or age group. He then proves that this concept can go even further when he takes the cover pages of Sports Illustrated magazines as *raw material*, which he classifies in order of publication or according to the celebrity that is showcased, and all this in a just a few clicks. It is when he begins to manipulate information straight out of Wikipedia that we understand the real scope that this project can have. With the principles of data visualization, Flake proves to us that the idea of Web browsing to which we have become accustomed rests in fact only on few intuitive elements.

> «We’re navigating the web for the first time as if it were actually a web. Not from page to page, but at a higher level of abstraction.»

> «Instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information. And, instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge. And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there’s wisdom to be found.»
