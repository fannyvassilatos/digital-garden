Everythink is a research project I initiated as my Bachelor of Design graduate project back in 2016. The first online version of this was a [crappy self-coded page](http://fannyvassilatos.github.io/pdfe/tests2.html) with way too many scroll bars.

The thing is, I can never consider this project as finished. It's like an ongoing repository of what I wish the Web could become. 

I aim to document the concrete ways in which the Internet can move away from ad-based revenue models, the centralization of information sources and the fragmentation of ecosystems. 

I've decided to document this journey using GitBook as my medium to have this live online, while keeping it easy for me to update. I write markdown files in iAWriter and push the changes via SourceTree to GitHub, which in turns updates this GitBook.

For now, I'm just publishing that original draft from 2016 even though the Internet landscape has greatly evolved. This is at once an accountability mechanism for myself and a sharing vector for others who are interested in this as well and might have something to contribute.

## About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Fanny.
I design interfaces for work and write for fun.
I'm interested in how Internet technologies can enable humanity to reach its full potential. 
I've always been amazed by the potential of the Internet and feel deep sorrow for how narrowly we seem to be leveraging it as an aid to our development as a species. 
Of course, this is deeply intertwined with other aspects of the human civilization like capitalism and politics but hey, that's just how big I like to dream.
If you care about these same things and want to keep in the loop, I publish some writing [on my website](https://www.fannyvassilatos.com) and try to [tweet](https://twitter.com/FannyVassilatos) funny things.
