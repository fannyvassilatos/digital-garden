## Intro
Individual personalization would be the basic principle of this ideal platform. We need to get away from social aggregation because no, "what's popular in your network" is not necessarily relevant to you at this precise moment.
This is about giving back control to the user so they can precisely select the information "channels" they want to receive in their daily life.
It's up to them to customize their interface, and to control the feeds that enter their digital habitat. There also has to be a change in terms of search engines. Our search results are too often biased by poorly targeted advertising and the influence of the data collected from our social networks.

## Content curation
We can start by addressing content curation. This is the essence of Web navigation, it provides us with an entry point, a starting point. There exists 3 main content curation methods. First, there is collaborative filtering. This principle is based on the amounts of votes and views by peers. Youtube and Amazon notably base their recommendations on this structure. Secondly, social rating is based on users' comments and recommendations. The system identifies a user with interests similar to ours to offer us recommendations based on their activity. Facebook and Flipboard use this method. The parameters to assess social value are based on the number of shares, likes and upvotes. The faster these accumulate, the more this piece of content gains value. Finally, there's semantic analysis which fits precisely into the perspective of my project. Based on the principle of analyzing facts and finding relations between the subject and object of the search query, this technique proceeds to a factual analysis of the information. In the Semantic Web perspective, the system dissects the content into subjects, sub-subjects and categories. We therefore use keywords directly linked to the information that the content contains, and not to quantitative factors such as algorithms or advertising biases.

#### 3 methods:
🚫 *Collaborative filtering*
Based on votes and views
Youtube, Amazon

🚫 *Social rating*
Based on user rating and recommendations. The system finds someone with interests similar to end user and bases it’s recommendations on their activity.
Facebook, Flipbook
Parameters for determining the social ranking are based on shares, likes, votes. The more of those in the shorter time, the higher rating the content gets.

✅ *Semantic Analysis*
Based on the principle of analyzing facts to find relationships between the studied phenomena and the object. (factor analysis) The system breaks up content according to topic, subtopic and category.
Semantic Web theory, tags. (No algorithms, no advertising biases)

#### Semantic Web
Principle of *content curation* ([Curator’s Code](http://curatorscode.org/) project by Maria Popova and Swiss Miss) 
A content curator ingests, analyzes and contextualizes web content and information of a particular nature onto a platform or into a format we can understand. *Mashable*

## Social Bookmarking
**Digg** 
An example of social aggregation could be the service offered by the Digg website. Instead of letting the content get sorted by curators, it's the community itself that proceed to the qualification of articles into Digg's feed.

Welcome to Digg.com, a user-driven news Web site that brings together hundreds of thousands of people to do the work of finding, submitting, reviewing and featuring news stories drawn from every corner of the Web. (How Stuff Works)

Are *collaborative filtering* and *social aggregation* the same?
Social tagging websites such as del.icio.us work by aggregating tags provided by many different taggers to form a kind of collective description for the webpage being tagged.
→ “Wisdom of the crowds” effect
Collaborative filtering: people with similar interests or needs view and tag pages we might be prone to stumble upon, and likewise, our « tagging twins » might be interested in the pages we have tagged.
**Delicio.us + digg** digg.com (social bookmarking like Stumble Upon and Diigo)
Google + and Google Bookmarks
“Delicious is the world’s largest social bookmarking site. With it you can save, manage and share pages in a centralized source.”

## Interest Graph APIs
[**Prismatic**](http://www.vbprofiles.com/tb/company/52b86aff843bac69b4000ac8/Prismatic/http%3A%2F%2Fventurebeat.com%2F2013%2F12%2F19%2Fprismatic-pivots-so-you-can-share-your-interests-online-without-bothering-people%2F#) 

Prismatic is an app that's unfortunately out of service. Besides its business model which turned out to be unsustainable, Prismatic had a very good idea.

Prismatic wanted to be the social network for your interests, a place to discover things on topics that interest you but that do not have to be on found on your Facebook or LinkedIn feeds. The small company had developed an *[Interest Graph API](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/prismatics-interest-graph-api-boosts-content-discoverability/2015/02/05).*

 “As Prismatic explains, the interest graph is "a model that helps us understand our users, their interests, publishers, content, and the connections between them. By aligning with users’ interests, the interest graph enables recommendations of products and content to deliver an experience that people care about." Access to the interest graph is what the new API allows.”

This personalised news aggregation app which shut down after 4 years of activity wanted to be the only news discovery app to bring you the best of everything you’re interested in.

“Four years ago, we set out to build a personalized news reader that would change the way people consume content,” the Prismatic team wrote in a blog post. “For many of you, we did just that. But we also learned content distribution is a tough business and we’ve failed to grow at a rate that justifies continuing to support our Prismatic News products.”

> “Current social networks box you in,” founder Bradford Cross told VentureBeat. “If you’re in tech, but also into cooking and hiking, it’s hard to follow enough cooking and hiking people, and your followers are probably expecting tech from you, so there’s social pressure to avoid sharing about cooking and hiking.”
