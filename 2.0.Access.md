## Intro
Individual personalization would be the basic principle of this ideal platform. We need to get away from social aggregation because no, "what's popular in your network" is not necessarily relevant to you at this precise moment.
This is about giving back control to the user so they can precisely select the information "channels" they want to receive in their daily life.
It's up to them to customize their interface, and to control the feeds that enter their digital habitat. There also has to be a change in terms of search engines. Our search results are too often biased by poorly targeted advertising and the influence of the data collected from our social networks.
