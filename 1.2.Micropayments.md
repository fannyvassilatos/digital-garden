## Micropayments

**Blendle**
In 2013, Alexander Klöpping and Marten Blankesteijn founded Blendle, a platform claiming to be the *[iTunes* of journalism](https://medium.com/@jortdevries/how-we-designed-the-itunes-of-journalism-46bf61c9e603#.4cskk3ww3) and that is based on the principle of micropayments. The service, offered up to now in the Netherlands and Germany, offers a digital place for journals and magazines to keep the essence of their identity.The Blendle team developed a unique CSS template for each one of the 75+ publications they house. They manage a library of more than 200 web fonts to allow for each individual article to reflect the identity of the magazine or journal it comes from.

The idea behind the principle of micropayments it to allow users to pay only for the articles they like/want. Blendle even allows users to get their [$0.25 back](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/pay-25-cents-read-article-blendle-certainly-thinks/)for an article they'd accidentally clicked on, or which they simply didn't enjoy reading. 

Their debut in the Netherlands was successful; after 6 months, 140 000 people were using their service. That's almost the whole country's population! One month after their Germany launch, they had already attracted more than half a million users.

> «We believe that a big part of our success so far comes from our design: we think the layout of an article is as important as the article itself, and that’s why we invested a lot of time and money creating a premium reading experience.»

> «A tabloid article should look a bit trashy, an article from a stylish magazine should look, well, stylish, and an article from The New York Times should feel like it’s an article from The New York Times.»

> «What if the reading experience of articles in Blendle would be as close as possible to the original experience of the articles? The results were stunning: by using different fonts, colors and layouts for every single newspaper and magazine, the articles suddenly felt more valuable.»

Blendle creates a CSS template for each publication and they retrieve the respective fonts to keep the essence of the publication. « The consequence of creating a new CSS template for our current 75+ newspapers and magazines is a huge font-set of 200+ web-fonts. »
