# Dissemination

## Intro
In this utopian platform, the sources of information would be unified, simplified, stripped of any superfluous elements â€” without setting aside the identity of each source of information. In the most logical way possible, the user could browse content that is exclusively relevant to him. 

Ideally, outstripping the attention economy would reduce waste of time, attention and concentration. Thus, the user could remain in the flow of his creation, his research, his curiosity. It would offer an instinctive user experience, where the importance is put in the right places, where the information is hierarchical and optimized for cognitive activity.
