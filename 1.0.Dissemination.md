# Dissemination

{{TOC}}

## Intro
In this utopian platform, the sources of information would be unified, simplified, stripped of any superfluous elements — without setting aside the identity of each source of information. In the most logical way possible, the user could browse content that is exclusively relevant to him. 

Ideally, outstripping the attention economy would reduce waste of time, attention and concentration. Thus, the user could remain in the flow of his creation, his research, his curiosity. It would offer an instinctive user experience, where the importance is put in the right places, where the information is hierarchical and optimized for cognitive activity. 

## System to garantee trifecta

Chapter 6: The Knowledge Portal, quick access to the best information on all topics

The main difficulty of browsing the web is to find the most reliable and quality sources. Google gives us quick access to millions of links (many of which are sponsored) but gives access to biased content. "In an ideal world, an Internet search engine should help us find the best, most neutral and most objective sources of information on all topics."

Jean Lanoix theorizes a globalized Internet service that would be overseen by an international organization called the "Knowledge Portal" and whose mission would be to "offer quick access to the best knowledge available on the planet to date". Its business model would be the reason for its success. This portal would be an international pole of attraction for the world leaders in all fields. Groups of specialists and independent experts from  different fields would collaborate with filmmakers and production companies to create multimedia documents that would meet the portal's selection criteria. The content must absolutely correspond to the requirements of the organization. Organizations can proudly display the official Knowledge Portal Accreditation logo on their home page if they meet the following 8 criteria:

1. Always provide the best information available (recent and reliable information)
2. Strive to convey information that is easy to understand for the general public and even for more targeted audiences (popularization effort)
3. Do not accept funding from sponsors who might have interests in the knowledge field (Possibility to obtain sponsorships, as long as donations from private foundations do not affect the information on the site)
4. Accept a limited amount of advertising by advertisers with a special interest in the subject (20%)
5. Have no direct affiliation to organizations of activists or political and union interest groups (prohibited affiliations because these "committed" organizations tend to present information in order to generate emotional reactions from the public )
6. Do not own, in whole or in part, a business or organization with interests to protect or promote (the organization must prove that there is no source of conflict of interest)
7. Constantly seek objectivity and maintain efforts in this direction through the use of contextual feedback functions (perfect objectivity is utopian. On the screen, a feedback icon is always present and allows any user to send comments)
8. Do not sell products and services other than information (must not sell products and services that place them in a conflict of interest)

Possible solutions for the Knowledge Portal to emerge right now: targeted advertising + micropayments.

## Micropayments

**Blendle**
In 2013, Alexander Klöpping and Marten Blankesteijn founded Blendle, a platform claiming to be the *[iTunes* of journalism](https://medium.com/@jortdevries/how-we-designed-the-itunes-of-journalism-46bf61c9e603#.4cskk3ww3) and that is based on the principle of micropayments. The service, offered up to now in the Netherlands and Germany, offers a digital place for journals and magazines to keep the essence of their identity.The Blendle team developed a unique CSS template for each one of the 75+ publications they house. They manage a library of more than 200 web fonts to allow for each individual article to reflect the identity of the magazine or journal it comes from.

The idea behind the principle of micropayments it to allow users to pay only for the articles they like/want. Blendle even allows users to get their [$0.25 back](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/pay-25-cents-read-article-blendle-certainly-thinks/)for an article they'd accidentally clicked on, or which they simply didn't enjoy reading. 

Their debut in the Netherlands was successful; after 6 months, 140 000 people were using their service. That's almost the whole country's population! One month after their Germany launch, they had already attracted more than half a million users.

> «We believe that a big part of our success so far comes from our design: we think the layout of an article is as important as the article itself, and that’s why we invested a lot of time and money creating a premium reading experience.»

> «A tabloid article should look a bit trashy, an article from a stylish magazine should look, well, stylish, and an article from The New York Times should feel like it’s an article from The New York Times.»

> «What if the reading experience of articles in Blendle would be as close as possible to the original experience of the articles? The results were stunning: by using different fonts, colors and layouts for every single newspaper and magazine, the articles suddenly felt more valuable.»

Blendle creates a CSS template for each publication and they retrieve the respective fonts to keep the essence of the publication. « The consequence of creating a new CSS template for our current 75+ newspapers and magazines is a huge font-set of 200+ web-fonts. »

“You only pay for the stories that you love” (Yes, you can ask for a 0.25$ refund for that article you accidentally clicked on)

## [Chatbots](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3058818/how-facebooks-big-bet-on-chatbots-might-remake-the-ux-of-the-web) (WeChat and soon Facebook)

The point of this chapter is not so much about what bots bring to the Dissemination aspect (well yeah actually, the idea that the users fetched information instead of being fed it) but mainly the integrated experience that WeChat offers (pocket article).

- Bots or Conversational Uxs
- Ubiquitous messaging

Chatbots are communications spaces that take the form of instant messaging interfaces, but that actually share content generated by bots —virtual agents or conversational agents— managed by companies and based on keywords. [In China](http://www.fastcompany.com/3056721/most-innovative-companies/a-week-behind-the-great-firewall-of-china?utm_content=buffer3ff0a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer), the digital landscape is vastly different than ours. There, censorship is severe and the inhabitants, not having access to Google or Facebook, rely on the widely used app WeChat for virtually everything related to information retrieval on the web. It's on WeChat that they have group chats between friends, but it's also via WeChat bots that they order a taxi, look up the weather, or get their news. This centralized system has proven to be very intuitive and has quickly integrated the daily lives of the people. Of course, the chatbot phenomenon is gradually exiting the walls of China. Facebook has recently announced they'd integrate some bots within the Messenger app.

> “What are bots? Think of them as interactive services that provide a conversational experience and contrast them with traditional “static” apps.” 
Phil Libin (Medium)

> “In a static UX, you have to learn how to operate each control; push this tab to go here, then swipe left, then push the little ‘i’ button, and so on. In a conversational UX… you just have a conversation. This doesn’t necessarily mean speech input and output, or texting, although it’ll often include those elements. It means that the product understands what you want to do and responds dynamically.”

> “That’s going to require a whole new approach to design.”

any company can now build a chatbot that users can talk with.

> "To me it's about bringing back all the best parts of the interaction between people and businesses," David Marcus, vice president of messaging products at Facebook, says in an interview. "What we’re trying to build with bots are rich conversational experiences. That’s what we believe will be the future of interactions and services."

But there are deep reasons why chatbots make sense. The app model has stalled out: People don’t use a ton of apps, and they don’t download many either. The reason is simple: There’s an enormous amount of friction associated with learning about a new app, downloading it, signing up for it, and then remembering you even have it.

> “That’s why the experience with bots is less free-form than real chat. You’re presented with a series of options that you click, progressively telling the bot your preferences for how often you’ll be notified or what kinds of information you’d like to receive—"Like a *Goosebumps* choose your own adventure book," explains Jeremy Goldberg, a product designer for business and platform at Facebook.”

Bots are going to be based on four design guidelines: That the bots should be conversational, issuing messages in a natural tone of voice and short, pithy responses paced quickly but not so quickly that the bot is oppressively present—like a chat partner hanging on your every word and expecting just as quick of a response. The responses themselves can be interactive bubbles. Some let you horizontally scroll through a list of sweatshirts via Everlane or a list of popular stories via CNN. Others present options that you can tap—for example, you could share your present location with a weather app like Poncho—thus quickly making your conversations more useful.
