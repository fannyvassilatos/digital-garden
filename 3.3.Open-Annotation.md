## Open Annotation

[**Hypothes.is**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCkm0lL-6lc) 
The mission of Hypothesis is to create a whole new "layer" over the Web; a higher level of information where annotation and discussion are open to everyone and allow the free sharing of knowledge. The Hypothesis team claims to be able to allow “a conversation over the world’s knowledge.” Their watchword is "interoperable": Interoperability is the ability of a product or system, whose interfaces are fully known, to work with other existing or future products or systems without restriction of access or implementation. From an open source perspective, they believe that simple tools can help us all improve the quality of the information on the Internet. 

> « Our team is building an open platform for discussion on the web. It leverages annotation to enable sentence-level critique or note taking on top of news, blogs, scientific articles, books, terms of service, ballot initiatives, legislation and more. Everything we build is guided by our principles. In particular that it be free, open, non-profit, neutral and lasting to name a few.”

Annotating All Knowledge

*A new open layer is being created over all knowledge.*

A coalition of some of the world’s key scholarly publishers, platforms, libraries, and technology organizations are coming together to create an open, interoperable annotation layer over their content.

For personal note-taking, peer review, copy editing, post-publication discussion, journal clubs…

It is going to bring this new layer upon human knowledge, an additional strata of conversation over publications

Annotating is a way of us understanding the social impact of the work that we do.

[Content Mine](http://contentmine.org/) founder, Peter Murray Rust, states that the principle of open annotation carries political value.

> « Politically, it’s terribly important that citizens of the world feel that they own the public Web and that it’s not controlled by central providers that have a narrow and very often monetary oriented way of presenting this content. So it’s democracy, and it’s innovation.»
